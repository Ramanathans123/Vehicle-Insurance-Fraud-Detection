# Vehicle Insurance Claim Fraud Detection

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent vehicle insurance claims using machine learning and deep learning techniques. It compares an Explainable AI-based Random Forest model with an LSTM neural network.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature encoding
- Fraud detection using Random Forest (N-XAI)
- Sequential modeling using LSTM
- Accuracy comparison across multiple iterations
- Visualization of model performance

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
